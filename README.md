## Note

This is created just for **Educational purposes**. You can't just use this application for commercial purposes. Although, if code is updated in aright way, in right places, you can add more functionalities and make it perfect for commercial use also.

## Troubleshoot

If you can't run this, due to any error related to database connection or something else, I have provided the **database.sql** file. You can use this file to create the database from scratch on you system, which will eliminate a lot of potential  issues.
